# MyFirstInventorAddin

This addin simplifies a few daily tasks faced by Inventor users.

It displays several "standard" Inventor iProperties in a non-intrusive dockable browser window.

There are also a few functions built-in that reduce the number of clicks a user might make throughout the course of a project.
