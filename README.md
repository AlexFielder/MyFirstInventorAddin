# MyFirstInventorAddin
This is an attempt at a "First Addin" for Autodesk Inventor

This is an exercise in Automation that originally spawned as a pre-cursor to some training I carried out for my employer Graitec UK Ltd.

The initial commit consisted of a basic Add-in for Autodesk Inventor and demonstrated a couple of things:

1) how to create a custom add-in.
2) how to add a button to the Inventor ribbonbar.
3) how to add a dockablewindow containing a Windows Form with a couple of dialogue boxes.

It has since been worked on for several hours to create the current build available (as of 2017-03-21 this exists in the JamesSmith branch)
